# Image Compression with K-Means Clustering

This project demonstrates how K-Means clustering can be used to compress images by reducing the number of colors.

## How It Works
- Loads an image
- Applies K-Means to cluster pixel colors
- Reconstructs the image using fewer colors

## How to Run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Insert an img and rename it as "sample.jfif"
python compress_image.py
